#Biomes, put biome names separated by comma, example:
#biomes = Ice Plains
#Will try to find the highest position to spawn, better avoid any biome with hills

biomes = Ice Plains

#chance define the ratio at wich the dungeon spawn, if set to 0 the dungeon will be disabled.
#The formula goes like that: every 5 chunks there is 1 between the number set to chance probabilities to spawn a dungeon.

chance = 10

#mob: defines the mob spawned in that dungeon
mob = walker

#icon: used as the item icon intex in the dungeon spawner item. (look at textures/items/bd/ d1, d2..., only the number is required)

#Builder allows you to choose what builder does the dungeon use
builder = templateSurface


#Special data for templateSurface
#folder: the folder containing the templates
#underGroundOffset: how many block will be used under the ground.
